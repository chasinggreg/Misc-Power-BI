Help me add or replace descriptions for each measure.
Consider the following rules:
- insert or replace the description that should appear above the measure code and after ///
- use business friendly terms
- describe the DAX code in the description in business-friendly terms. Do not copy the code to the description.
- use the name and other measures as context
- description should not be longer than 500 chars
